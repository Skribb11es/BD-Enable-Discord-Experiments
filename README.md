# BD-Enable-Discord-Experiments
Enables the "Experiments" category in discord via a Better Discord plugin

## Usage
Just like any other better discord plugin, navigate to Settings>Plugins>Open Plugins Folder then drag and drop "EnableExperiments.plugin.js" into that folder, and enable it via the toggle in the plugins tab back in BD.

This is 100% a rip of [pjotrek](https://github.com/pjotrekdev)'s script, that was then adapted to be automated via a BD plugin. The original script can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/MPThLee/3ccb554b9d882abc6313330e38e5dfaa?permalink_comment_id=4334620#gistcomment-4334620)
